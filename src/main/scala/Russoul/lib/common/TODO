Priority:
    Errors:
        1)see Mat4 (specialize it !)
    High:
        //Type everything !
        //TODO watch shapeless videos
        //TODO make universal matrix and vector classes (probably use arrays for representation of both) + type-checked sizes
       -3)matrices for 2d transformations
       -2)TODO Shapeless for statically sized collections and more !!
       -1)overriding abstract typeclass method with field for better performance (like 'one' or 'zero') throws runtime exception, why ?
        0)remove Vec use Array instead !
        1)write tests
        2)see if @sp is set in all places needed
        3)assertions
        4)//TODO fix Mat.apply calls indexing from 0 but not from 1
        5)make Vec, Mat and other containers be scala friendly(support native operations or
         maybe even extend common types)
        6)remove shitty column field in Vec, use special container or trait to indicate row vectors, column vectors are default
    Medium:
       -1)make better renderers (RenderXXX), make them inherit common interface, make them smart, rethink whole idea
        0)write crossplatform rendering library
        1)instantiate typeclass from string at compile time ? or at least at run time
    Low:
        1)prob remove all the inline annotations that are unnecessary(are warned by the compiler as they can not be inlined "-Yinline-warnings")
